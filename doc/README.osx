Mac OS X Build Instructions
===========================

Building Boost with ASIO:
-------------------------

Please see the README.boost file for instructions.
There are no known problems on OS X.


Installing zlib & openssl:
--------------------------

ASIO requires zlib and openssl for compression and SSL/TLS encryption
support, respectively.  These libraries are pre-installed on OS X.
However, you may instead choose to download and install the latest
versions from the following sites:

http://www.zlib.net
http://www.openssl.org


Logging frameworks:
-------------------

Note that the use of a logging framework is entirely optional, so you may
skip this step if you like.

If you have MacPorts (http://www.macports.org) already installed, it is easy
to use it to install the log4cpp library:

sudo port install log4cpp

If you do not have MacPorts or prefer to compile the logging framework from
source, you can download the tarballs from the following sites:

http://logging.apache.org/log4cxx
http://log4cpp.sourceforge.net

Note that the log4cplus library does not build properly under OS X, so you
will need to use log4cxx or log4cpp instead.


Building and installing libpion:
--------------------------------

Now you should be able to build and install libpion:

tar xvfz libpion-VERSION.tar.gz
cd libpion-VERSION
./configure --with-boost=/usr/local
	[--with-openssl] [--with-log4cpp=/opt/local]
make ; sudo make install
