Installing Boost with ASIO
==========================

Starting with 0.4.0, Pion requires Boost 1.34.1 with ASIO 0.3.9 (or
later). Since these are both fairly recent releases, none of our
supported platforms currently have pre-built versions available of these
libraries.  Therefore, you will likely need to download, compile and
install Boost and ASIO using the source tarballs.

Note that although the ASIO library is not currently included in the
Boost distribution, it has been accepted into the library and will be
included in a future release (most likely 1.35.0).  You can use it with
the current Boost release by just copying ASIO's files into the Boost
source tree.


Obtaining Boost with ASIO (the easy way):
=========================================

Atomic Labs provides a source code tarball for Boost with ASIO, including all
the necessary patches available for download on the "Third Party Libraries"
page of our website.  We recommend that you download and uncompress this
file.  However, if you'd prefer to prepare everything yourself, here is what
you need to do:


Obtaining Boost with ASIO (the hard way):
=========================================

First, download the latest tarballs from SourceForge.net:

# wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/boost/boost_1_34_1.tar.bz2
# wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/asio/boost_asio_0_3_9.tar.bz2

Next, uncompress the tarballs and copy the ASIO files into the Boost
directory:

# bzip2 -dc boost_1_34_1.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -
# bzip2 -dc boost_asio_0_3_9.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -
# tar cvf - -C boost_asio_0_3_9 boost libs | tar xf - -C boost_1_34_1

(If you are using a graphical tool, make sure that you copy all of the
ASIO files into the same directory that you extracted Boost into --
select "Yes to All" for replacing existing files).

Boost 1.34.1 includes a bug (Boost ticket #1062) that you will need to 
patch before building it under Cygwin.  There is also a thread safety bug
which has been identified within the Boost.Function library (Boost ticket
# 1260).  A patch file to fix both of these bugs is included in the
"<PROJECT_ROOT>/common/doc" directory:

# patch -p0 < <PROJECT_ROOT>/common/doc/boost_1_34_1.patch

Finally, configure, build and install the Boost libraries (now with
ASIO). You have two options:


Build using the configure script:
---------------------------------

The configure script provides the easiest way to build and install
Boost. However, with the configure script you cannot specify alternative
compilers (this is auto-detected) and you also must build all of the
Boost libraries, which can be very time-consuming (note that Pion requires
only six of them).  Building Boost with the configure script also requires
that you have a UNIX shell interpreter (/bin/sh) and the make utility
installed on your system.

# cd boost_1_34_1
# ./configure
# make all
# make install  (this may require superuser/Administrator privileges)


Build using the bjam utility:
-----------------------------

bjam (http://www.boost.org/tools/build/v2/index.html) is a tool you can
use to build Boost that allows you to configure many different options
for your build. For a description of options available when building
Boost with bjam, please see the Getting Started Guide at
http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started/. You can download
pre-compiled bjam executables from:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586&package_id=72941

You only need to build seven of the Boost libraries for Pion: thread,
system, filesystem, regex, date_time, signals and unit_test_framework. If
you wish to only build these seven libraries (this will save you a lot of
time), include the following options when running bjam: "--with-thread
--with-system --with-filesystem --with-regex --with-date_time
--with-signals --with-test"

For example (when using Microsoft Visual C++):

# bjam --toolset=msvc --with-thread --with-system --with-filesystem \
	--with-regex --with-date_time --with-signals --with-test \
	debug release threading=multi stage

This will build the six libraries required by Pion and place the
files within the stage/ subdirectory of your build directory.

To install, you can now just copy the files in stage/lib into your
library include path, and copy the boost/ directory into your header
include path.


Note: Some platforms require additional steps for building Boost & ASIO. 
Please see the appropriate README.platform file for more information.
