FreeBSD Build Instructions
==========================

Building Boost with ASIO:
-------------------------

Please see the README.boost file for instructions.


Installing zlib & openssl:
--------------------------

ASIO requires zlib and openssl for compression and SSL/TLS encryption
support, respectively.  These libraries are pre-installed on FreeBSD.
However, you may instead choose to download and install the latest
versions from the "Third Party Libraries" page on our website, or from
the following sites:

http://www.zlib.net
http://www.openssl.org


Logging frameworks:
-------------------

Note that the use of a logging framework is entirely optional, so you may
skip this step if you like.

We recommend that you use log4cxx for logging.  The easiest way to install
log4cxx is to use the included ports package:

# pkg_add -r log4cxx

However, we suggest that you use the most recent version of log4cxx instead
of the included packages, which are several years old.  The most recent
versions of log4cxx (starting with 0.10.x) require the Apache Portable
Runtime (APR).  The best way to install APR on FreeBSD is to use the included
ports package:

# pkg_add -r apr

After installing APR, please visit the "Third Party Libraries" page on our
website to obtain the latest source code tarball for log4cxx. Then, just run:

# tar xvfj log4cxx-<version>.tar.bz2
# cd log4cxx-<version>
# ./configure
# make all
# make install


Installing libxml2:
-------------------

The Pion Platform requires the libxml2 development library for 
manipulating configuration files, and other things.  This library is not 
used by the Pion Network Library, so you may skip this step if you are 
only building the Network Library.

The easiest way to install libxml2 on FreeBSD is to use the included ports
package:

# pkg_add -r libxml2


Installing OSSP uuid:
---------------------

The Pion Platform requires the OSSP uuid library to generate universally 
unique identifiers for most platforms, including FreeBSD.  This library is 
not used by the Pion Network Library, so you may skip this step if you 
are only building the Network Library.

You can download the source code tarball for the uuid library from the 
"Third Party Libraries" page on our website.  After downloading it, just 
run:

# tar xvfz uuid-<version>.tar.gz
# cd uuid-<version>
# ./configure
# make all
# make install


Installing SQLite:
------------------

SQLite version 3 is required to build support for the embedded database
(the SQLiteDatabase plugin).  You may skip this step if you do not want
to build support for the embedded database.

You can download the source code tarball for SQLite from the  "Third
Party Libraries" page on our website.  After downloading it, just run:

# tar xvfz sqlite-amalgamation-<version>.tar.gz
# cd sqlite-amalgamation-<version>
# ./configure --enable-threads
# make all
# make install


Building and installing Pion:
-----------------------------

Now you should be able to build and install Pion:

# tar xvfz pion-<PROJECT>-<VERSION>.tar.gz
# cd pion-<PROJECT>-<VERSION>
# ./configure [--with-openssl] [--with-log4cxx=/usr/local] [--with-sqlite]
# make all
# make install

To build and run Pion's unit tests, run "make check"
