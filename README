See COPYING for licensing information.

Build and installation summary:

# ./configure --with-boost=/path/to/boost
# make all
# make install

See INSTALL or run "./configure --help" for more detailed instructions.

Detailed build instructions are available for all of the platforms supported
by libpion within the "doc" subdirectory (README.platform).  Please read these
instructions first.

Starting with 0.2.0, libpion REQUIRES the Boost C++ libraries (version
1.34.0 or greater), and the Boost ASIO library (version 0.38 or
greater). Please see the README.boost file within the "doc" subdirectory
for instructions on how to download, build and install these libraries.

Boost ASIO additionally requires OpenSSL for SSL/TLS support and zlib for
compression.  You can download these libraries from the following locations:

http://www.openssl.org
http://www.zlib.net

For logging, libpion may be configured to:

a) disable logging entirely (the default configuration)
b) use std::cout and std::cerr for logging (configure --with-ostream-logging)
c) use one of the following open source libraries: log4cxx, log4cpp or
   log4cplus (configure using one of --with-log4cxx, --with-log4cpp or
   --with-log4cplus, respectively)

You can download these logging libraries from the following locations:

http://logging.apache.org/log4cxx
http://log4cpp.sourceforge.net
http://log4cplus.sourceforge.net

Please note that not all of these libraries work on all platforms.  Please
see the README.platform files for more information.
